# Supply Chain Management System

## Project Description
A blockchain-based system for tracking product lifecycle from creation through ownership transfers and status updates. Provides immutable records of product history using Ethereum smart contracts.

## Project Vision
To create a transparent, tamper-proof supply chain solution that enhances accountability among manufacturers, distributors, and retailers while reducing counterfeit risks.

## Key Features
- Product registration with unique identifiers
- Real-time ownership tracking
- Status update functionality (e.g., "Manufactured", "Shipped", "Delivered")
- Immutable audit trail of all transactions

## Future Scope
- Role-based access control for different supply chain participants
- IoT integration for automated status updates
- NFT-based product certification
- Multi-chain compatibility for broader adoption
- Supplier rating system using decentralized oracles
